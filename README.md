OVERVIEW 

Increase in population has resulted in the growth of automobiles leading to a
surge in traffic. Often traffic jams occur due to the escalation in the number of
vehicles wqon the road. Adhering to the absence of lane systems in countries
like India an ambulance or any emergency vehicle find it tenuous to navigate
through the traffic and the journey is disrupted. This project aims at providing a
solution to the above problem by controlling the traffic signal as an ambulance
approaches the traffic signal, using the concept of Internet of Things (IoT)
integrates with an android application. The system also alerts the general public
at the signal about the approaching ambulance by activating the white light
indicator placed at each signal-junction. This system uses a central server
(Firebase) to control the traffic controllers. The traffic signal controller is
implemented using Arduino NANO and NodeMCU. The mobile application
keeps track of the current location of the ambulance and automatically intimates
the nearby traffic signal and turns it to green. Once the ambulance crosses the
junction the signals are restored to its previous state. As this system of
trafficking incurs low cost, it can be implemented throughout the city thereby
reducing the number of deaths by allowing the ambulance to quickly skip the
traffic and reach the destination as early as possible. This application can be
extended by sending patient details to the hospital for future endeavours.
